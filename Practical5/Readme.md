ðŸ“Š Statistics and Data Analysis Practicals

Welcome to my Statistics and Data Analysis repository!
This space showcases all my hands-on lab exercises, assignments, and mini-projects completed during my statistics coursework. Each practical demonstrates how theoretical concepts are transformed into real-world insights using data-driven techniques.

ðŸ§¾ Practicals Summary

The repository is structured by practical numbers, with each folder containing a specific task or experiment that explores a distinct statistical method or dataset.

ðŸ§  Core Topics Explored

Across these practicals, Iâ€™ve worked with a broad range of statistical and analytical concepts, such as:

Descriptive & Inferential Analysis

Probability and Sampling Distributions

Data Visualization â€“ Histograms, Scatterplots, and Bar Graphs

Hypothesis Testing â€“ t-tests, ANOVA, and Chi-Square Tests

Correlation & Regression Modeling

Confidence Interval Estimation

ðŸ›  Tools and Technologies

All analyses were performed using Python, leveraging some of its most powerful data science libraries:

pandas â†’ Data manipulation and cleaning

NumPy â†’ Numerical and mathematical operations

Matplotlib & Seaborn â†’ Visualization and graphical representation

SciPy â†’ Advanced statistical computations

scikit-learn â†’ Machine learning and predictive modeling

ðŸ’¡ Purpose

This repository serves as a comprehensive record of my learning journey â€” combining statistical reasoning with coding practice to solve data analysis problems effectively.
